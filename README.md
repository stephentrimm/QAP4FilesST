The two python programs are written by Stephen Trimm.
Dates written: July 16th- July 26th, 2023
Main.Py is a Python program for One Stop Insurance Company that inputs customer data and processes all costs related to the insurance claim. The program then displays the inputs and calculations in a well-designed receipt for readability. 
The default values (the constants) for the program are written to a file called 'OSICDEF.dat'
The customer-specific claim information is then saved to a file called 'Policies.dat'. Each time a record is saved, the next policy number is increased by one.  Each customer record is saved on an individual line in this file for future reference
graph.py is the second program for One Stop Insurance Company that allows the user to input the total sales per month (January to December). A bar graph is created with the months on the x-axis and the sales (dollars) on the y-axis.
